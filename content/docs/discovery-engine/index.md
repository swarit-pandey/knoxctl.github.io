AccuKnox's Discovery Engine plays a crucial role in securing and observing workloads by generating policies and telemetry information. It works in conjunction with `knoxctl`, a tool that fetches information from the Discovery Engine operating within the `accuknox-agents` namespace.

## Key Features

- **Policy Generation:** The Discovery Engine creates discovered policies and recommended hardening policies, aiding in the effective management and security of workloads.

- **Telemetry Data Summarization:** It provides summaries of telemetry data collected by Kubearmor, focusing on specific network, file, and process events occurring within the cluster. This data is instrumental in understanding and monitoring the operational aspects of the workloads.

By leveraging the Discovery Engine, users can gain valuable insights and maintain robust security standards for their cluster environments.

## Summary Command

The `summary` command in `knoxctl` connects to the Discovery Engine to provide observability data, utilizing telemetry information from KubeArmor.

### Summary Usage

```bash
knoxctl summary [flag] [option]
```

### Summary Flags

| Flag                              | Description                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--dump`                          | Dump JSON and text data to `knoxctl_out` directory and skip the TUI.  |
| `--glance`                        | Take a quick glance at summary data.                                   |
| `--gRPC <string>`                 | Connect to a gRPC endpoint.                                            |
| `-n`, `--namespace <stringArray>` | Specify the namespace for which you need to get the summary information. |
| `-o`, `--operation <string>`      | Filter summary by type: `process`, `file`, or `network`.               |
| `-v`, `--view <string>`           | Output format in the terminal, available in JSON or table format.      |

### Regex Support

We support RE2 regex syntax which you can use to filter out namespaces. To filter namepaces using regex you can do the following:

`knoxctl summary -n '<regex-pattern>'` or `knoxctl summary --namespace '<regex-pattern>'`

Essentially to filter out using regex you can do the following

`knoxctl summary [flag] '<regex-pattern>'`

## Discover Command

The `discover` subcommand connects to Discovery Engine to fetch the discovered policies generated based on specific workloads. These are targeted policies for workloads to maintain robust security.

### Discover Usage

```bash
knoxctl discover [flag] [options]
```

### Discovery Flags

| Flag                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--dump`              | Dump policies to `knoxctl_out` directory and skip TUI.                      |
| `--gRPC <string>`     | Provide gRPC server information.                                            |
| `-l`, `--labels <strings>` | Filter by policy label.                                                      |
| `-n`, `--namespace <strings>` | Filter by namespace.                                                        |
| `-p`, `--policy <strings>`  | Specify the type of policies to be discovered (defaults to `[KubeArmorPolicy]`). |
| `-v`, `--view <string>` | View policies as table, yaml, or json.                                      |

### Network Policies

Discovery Engine also generates network policies. To fetch those, you can do the following

```bash
knoxctl discover -p NetworkPolicy
```

To get both network and kubearmor policies, you can do the following

```bash
knoxctl discover -p NetworkPolicy,KubearmorPolicy
```

## Recommend Command

The `recommend` command helps in hardening the workloads with industry standard hardening policies generated by Discovery Engine. These policies include multiple tags such as MITRE, PCI-DSS, etc. Application of these policies set a strong secure baseline for the workloads.

### Recommend Usage

```bash
knoxctl recommend [flag] [option]
```

### Recommend Flags

| Flag                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--dump`                 | Dump policies to `knoxctl_out` directory and skip TUI.                      |
| `--gRPC <string>`        | gRPC address of the discovery engine.                                       |
| `-h`, `--help`             | Display help information for the recommend command.                         |
| `-n`, `--namespace <strings>` | Filter by namespace.                                                        |
| `-p`, `--policy <strings>`     | Types of policy that can be recommended: `KubeArmorPolicy`, `KyvernoPolicy` (default: `[KubeArmorPolicy]`). |
| `-v`, `--view <string>`        | View policies as table, yaml, or json.                                      |
